A set of libraries to help you fetch, extract and transform data. It is:

* **Fast**: Zero-cost abstractions built on top of the [Tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/) ecosystem;
* **Useful**: Individually for a specific purpose or as a whole to write a complete data extraction pipeline;
* **Scalable**: Run your data extraction pipeline anywhere and everywhere.

A Free and Open Source project actively researched and developed by [Plabayo.tech](https://www.plabayo.tech/).

> **WARNING**: this project is a wild west research project, use at your own risk.
> You can contact [glen@plabayo.tech](mailto:glen@plabayo.tech) if you want to get involved.
